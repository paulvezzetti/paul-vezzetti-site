			`This website is my first experience with Svelte/SvelteKit. I spend my work day with <span style="font-family:'Inter'">Angular</span>, ` +
			`often migrating old <span style="font-family:'Inter'">AngularJS</span> code to newer <span style="font-family:'Inter'">Angular</span>. ` +
			`This is a opportunity to try out a more modern framework built with many of the lessons of <span style="font-family:'Inter'">Angular</span> ` +
			`and <span style="font-family:'Inter'">React</span> in mind. ` +
			`I learned a lot as part of this project.<br><br>` +
			`First, while I'm not a <span style="font-family:'Inter'">Svelte</span> expert after this experiment, it is easy to see the parallels with <span style="font-family:'Inter'">Angular</span>. ` +
			`All the concepts that I'm used to using in <span style="font-family:'Inter'">Angular</span> are available in <span style="font-family:'Inter'">Svelte</span>, ` +
			`often with less boilerplate and more standard-based implementations. ` +
			`I really appreciate the simplicity compared to <span style="font-family:'Inter'">Angular</span>.<br><br>` +
			`I also learned that I'm not a designer and I have amazing appreciation for all of the talented designers that I've worked with. ` +
			`This site isn't particularly captivating from a design perspective. I modeled the appearance off of a typical IDE in Dark Mode. ` +
			`That is where I am most comfortable and I suspect most visitors to my site will be as well.`

			`I was hired at <span style="font-family:'Inter'">Mode</span> to help complete the new visualization builder ` +
			`tool called <span style="font-family:'Inter'">Visual Explorer</span>. This marked a transition for <span style="font-family:'Inter'">Mode</span> from ` +
			`being chart-type centric to a more flexible, Grammar-of-Graphics ` +
			`designer tool. We worked across two internal development teams plus a ` +
			`remote external company in India to deliver the first release.<br><br> ` +
			`With my background in business intelligence and data visualization, my primary ` +
			`focus was on configuring the underlying visualization library, driving ` +
			`API requirements to the external team for the rendering library, and ` +
			`setting overall visualization direction.<br><br>` +
			`Over time as resources and priorities have shifted, I've taken on more ` +
			`of a traditional front-end developer role, though still exclusively ` +
			`related to data visualization. I generally lead small teams in ` +
			`developing new features, provide insight into new feature planning, ` +
			`and review architecture across multiple teams.`

			`This project at <span style="font-family:'Inter'">Mode</span> enabled an entirely new class of ` +
			`visualizations to be created using the <span style="font-family:'Inter'">Visual Explorer</span> tool. ` +
			`It allows multiple visualization layers to be stacked on top of one another using the same cartesian axes. ` +
			`This enabled building complex visualizations using basic building blocks. For example, a bullet chart could be ` +
			`created by stacking multiple bar and shape layers representing the measure, range and target values.`

			`This feature allowed the user to explore the underlying data behind any data element in the visualization. It was a big success and ` + 
            `won the coveted Hacker's Choice Award which is voted on by everyone at <span style="font-family:'Inter'">Mode</span>.<br><br>` +
            `Eventually, this feature was prioritized and added to the product as a standard feature. ` +
